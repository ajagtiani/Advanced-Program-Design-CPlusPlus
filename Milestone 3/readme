CS4 Project - Milestone 3 Readme
Parking lot puzzle 
Authors: Aditya Jagtiani, Ramnath Ananthraman
Group: p334-70d

The second milestone adds the following new files: river.cpp, river_config.h and river_config.cpp. 
The solver is pretty much the same, except for a few minor changes. 

The main function resides in river.cpp. As per the milestone 1 feedback, we have included string streams that prevent almost all invalid inputs. We have also added a few problem specific error checking mechanisms. 
The various functions and data members have been declared in river_config.h. We have included const correctness this time and used sensible variable and data member names! 
These functions are implemented in river_config.cpp. We have included special cases when the number of professors is 0 on either side and included step numbers this time. (Had forgotten to do so in the first milestone) 
As for the Solver.h file, we have resolved the differences between signed and unsigned variables. 

The 3rd milestone has the following files: Jam_config.h, Jam_config.cpp, jam.cpp. the solver remains the same from the previous milestone. 
Since this phase requires us to read and write to a file, we have included 
code to handle all 4 possibilities - file to file, console to file, file to console and console - console. The required methods and functions have been defined in Jam_config.h and implemented in Jam_config.cpp. The conditions are quite intricate and required intense dry-runs or paper executions to perfect. We have also eliminate various compilation warnings. 
We have also handles conditions where 2 cars collide, their coordinates are out of scope and many more file reading errors.
